# Contributing Guidelines

We're always open to external contributions. If you want to contribute code or add something to the documentation, open a pull request. If you want to discuss new ideas for Open1722 with us, simply create an issue. But before you create an issue or PR, please read the following contribution guidelines first so that the process will be as smooth and efficient as possible.

1. **Try to keep issues and pull requests small** and limit them to a single feature if possible. Instead of creating a big PR introducing multiple new features at once, try to split it up into smaller PRs.
2. **Adhere to the styleguide**. Especially when modifying the Open1722 library functions. The styleguide may look a little unconventional at first glance. However, it was explicitly chosen in alignment with AUTOSAR Classic so that Open1722 can easily be integrated into existing automotive software projects.
