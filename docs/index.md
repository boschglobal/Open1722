# Open1722

Open1722 is an open source implementation of the Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP) specified in IEEE Std. 1722. The IEEE 1722 protocol was originally developed for professional audio/video applications, but has since then has evolved and now also offers protocol formats for tunneling legacy busses such as CAN/LIN over Ethernet networks or provide remote access to peripheral interfaces such as I2C, SPI or GPIOs. This makes IEEE 1722 increasingly interesing for use in zonal automotive architectures, but also for other applications such as industrial automation, building technologies or home automation.

## The IEEE 1722 protocol

## About

The project is currently maintained by:

* [Naresh Nayak - Robert Bosch GmbH](https://github.com/nayakned)
* [Adriaan Niess - Robert Bosch GmbH](https://github.com/adriaan-niess)
* [Kamel Fakih - Robert Bosch GmbH](https://github.com/kamelfakihh/)

Open1722 was started by the advance engineering group for in-vehicle network communication (XC/EYA2) at Robert Bosch GmbH in 2024 by Naresh Nayak and Adriaan Niess. Initially starting out as a fork from *libavtp*, by now most of the code was rewritten and the focus was set on control formats relevant for use in automotive applications.
