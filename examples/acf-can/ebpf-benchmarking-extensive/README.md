# Open1722 benchmarking with eBPF

This project demonstrates benchmarking of Open1722 using eBPF and the cilium/ebpf library. Follow the steps below to set up your environment, build the binaries, and run the application.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements.

### Kernel Requirements

eBPF relies heavily on specific Linux kernel features. The capabilities for kprobes, tracepoints, and uprobes are generally available in modern kernel versions.

- General eBPF Support: Linux kernel 4.4 or newer is required for basic eBPF functionality.
- kprobes: Kernel-level dynamic tracing is available in Linux kernel 4.1 and later. For optimal performance and feature support, a kernel version of 4.14 or newer is recommended.
- tracepoints: Kernel-level static tracing is available in Linux kernel 4.7 and later.
- uprobes: User-space dynamic tracing is available in Linux kernel 4.3 and later.

You'll need a recent version of Go installed on your system. This project is developed and tested with Go 1.18 or newer.

#### Additional Tools

- Make: A build automation tool used to streamline the compilation process.
- Clang/LLVM: Required for compiling the eBPF C code into eBPF bytecode. A version of 9.0 or newer is recommended.
- libbpf-dev: Development headers for the libbpf library.

On a Debian-based system (like Ubuntu), you can install these dependencies with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential clang llvm libbpf-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local development environment set up and to build the project binaries.

### Install Go

Download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/):

Set up your Go workspace: Configure your `GOPATH` and `GOBIN` environment variables by adding the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOBIN
```

After editing the file, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify your installation: Open a new terminal session and run the following command to ensure Go is installed correctly:

```bash
go version
```

## Build the Project

This project uses a Makefile to simplify the build process.

1) You need to make some modifications in the main.go file as per your hardware architecture:

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/cilium/ebpf/cmd/bpf2go -target arm64 -cflags "-I/usr/include/aarch64-linux-gnu -I/usr/include/" CANTrace eBPF/bpf.c
```

When using the go:generate command with bpf2go, the -target flag specifies the architecture for which the eBPF program will be compiled. The supported targets are categorized by their endianness. Also adjust the path to includes. For instance, for target amd64, the default include path is /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu.

#### Possible Targets

The `bpf2go` tool supports the following architectures for the `-target` flag:

**Little-Endian Architectures:**
- `amd64` (x86)
- `arm64`
- `riscv64`
- `loong64`

For these targets, `bpf2go` generates files with the `_bpfel.o` and `_bpfel.go` suffixes, indicating little-endian byte order.

**Big-Endian Architectures:**
- `s390` (and `s390x`)
- `mips`
- `sparc`

For these targets, the generated files will have `_bpfeb.o` and `_bpfeb.go` suffixes, signifying big-endian byte order.

In your specific command, you have correctly used `-target arm64`, which is a valid and supported little-endian architecture.

2) Build the binaries: Run the make command in the root of the eBPF project benchmarking directory (not of Open1722). This will compile the eBPF C code and the Go user-space application.

```bash
make
```

This command will produce the necessary binaries in a designated bin folder.

### Results
After each run, the results are printed to the console and exported as CSV files with timestamps.

## Running the Application

Run `open1722-can-tracing-extensive` in `sudo` mode with necessary inputs.

For help, run `sudo open1722-can-tracing-extensive --help`

### Examples

1) Monitoring the userspace talker application, where:
 - The binary is located at `/home/pi/open1722-rs/Open1722-c/examples/build/acf-can/linux/acf-can-talker`
 - PID of the acf-can-talker is 37357

```bash
sudo ./open1722-can-tracing-extensive --pid-talker 37357 --talker-file /home/pi/open1722-rs/Open1722-c/examples/build/acf-can/linux/acf-can-talker
```

2) Monitoring the userspace listener application, where:
 - The binary is located at `/home/pi/open1722-rs/Open1722-c/examples/build/acf-can/linux/acf-can-listener`
 - PID of the acf-can-listener is 37390

```bash
sudo ./open1722-can-tracing-extensive --pid-listener 37390 --listener-file /home/pi/open1722-rs/Open1722-c/examples/build/acf-can/linux/acf-can-listener
```

3) Monitoring the kernel implementation:

```bash
sudo ./open1722-can-tracing-extensive --is-kernel
```
